# Python Workflow API

The Python Workflow API is the primary way to author Sophios workflows. It lets
you describe a workflow in the same place where you already have names,
functions, imports, tests, and reusable Python helpers, while still compiling to
portable CWL artifacts.

The API is intentionally centered on a small set of concepts:

- a `CommandLineTool` describes one executable tool,
- a `Step` places that tool inside a workflow graph,
- a `Workflow` owns the graph, named outputs, and compiled artifacts,
- assignments such as `cat.inputs.file = touch.outputs.file` record workflow
  bindings rather than executing commands immediately.

If you remember one rule, make it this: Python describes the graph; compilation
turns that graph into CWL and job inputs; execution happens after that.

## Scope

This page covers:

- what a `Step` represents,
- what a `Workflow` represents,
- how literal values bind to step inputs,
- how a step output becomes a later step input,
- what compilation produces,
- how to compile and inspect workflow artifacts,
- when to run locally,
- when to keep compiled CWL in memory for submission payload construction.

It does not cover every CWL feature. Advanced YAML controls, static dispatch,
and program synthesis are documented separately in
[Advanced YAML and Operations](advanced.md).

## Working Directory Assumption

Most examples in this guide assume you are running from the repository root:

```bash
cd /path/to/sophios
```

That makes checked-in adapter paths such as `cwl_adapters/echo.cwl` resolve
cleanly.

When writing reusable scripts, prefer `Path` objects over fragile string paths:

```python
from pathlib import Path

echo_tool = Path("cwl_adapters") / "echo.cwl"
```

## Step 1: Load a Tool as a Step

A `Step` is a CWL `CommandLineTool` placed inside a workflow context.

```python
from pathlib import Path

from sophios.apis.python.workflow import Step


echo = Step(Path("cwl_adapters") / "echo.cwl")
```

At this point, Sophios has loaded the tool contract. It knows the tool has an
input named `message` and an output named `stdout`.

You can inspect the ports:

```python
for input_port in echo.inputs:
    print(input_port.name, input_port.parameter_type)

for output_port in echo.outputs:
    print(output_port.name, output_port.parameter_type)
```

This interface is the contract Sophios uses for validation, binding, edge
inference, and generated CWL.

## Step 2: Bind a Literal Input

Bind a value to a step input:

```python
echo.inputs.message = "hello from Sophios"
```

That assignment does not run the tool. It records a workflow binding:

```text
echo.message <- "hello from Sophios"
```

Sophios will later turn that binding into the appropriate generated CWL job
input.

The older shorthand still works:

```python
echo.message = "hello from Sophios"
```

The docs use the explicit form because it is clearer:

- `step.inputs.<name>` is where values enter a step,
- `step.outputs.<name>` is where values leave a step.

## Step 3: Put Steps in a Workflow

Wrap the step in a workflow:

```python
from sophios.apis.python.workflow import Workflow


workflow = Workflow([echo], "hello_python")
```

A workflow has a name and an ordered list of children. Children may be concrete
steps or nested workflows.

Compile without running:

```python
workflow.write_artifacts()
```

Run locally:

```python
workflow.run()
```

The smallest complete example is therefore:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from sophios.apis.python.workflow import Step, Workflow


def build_workflow() -> Workflow:
    echo = Step(Path("cwl_adapters") / "echo.cwl")
    echo.inputs.message = "hello from Sophios"
    return Workflow([echo], "hello_python")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    build_workflow().run()
```

This example is intentionally small. It demonstrates the three required
operations for a runnable workflow: load a tool, bind an input, and run a
workflow.

## Step 4: Link Two Steps

Most workflows become useful when one step consumes another step's output.

```python
from pathlib import Path

from sophios.apis.python.workflow import Step, Workflow


touch = Step(Path("cwl_adapters") / "touch.cwl")
touch.inputs.filename = "empty.txt"

append = Step(Path("cwl_adapters") / "append.cwl")
append.inputs.file = touch.outputs.file
append.inputs.str = "Hello"

cat = Step(Path("cwl_adapters") / "cat.cwl")
cat.inputs.file = append.outputs.file

workflow = Workflow([touch, append, cat], "multistep_python")
workflow.write_artifacts()
```

Read the bindings as arrows:

```text
touch.outputs.file -> append.inputs.file
append.outputs.file -> cat.inputs.file
```

The Python assignment creates the edge. You do not need to hand-write a CWL
`source` field.

## Linear Edge Inference

The Python API can also use the same edge inference mechanism as `.wic`
workflows. In a linear workflow, if a required step input is not bound, Sophios
passes that missing input to the compiler. The compiler then looks backward
through earlier steps and connects the most recent compatible output.

That means this also works:

```python
touch = Step(Path("cwl_adapters") / "touch.cwl")
touch.inputs.filename = "empty.txt"

append = Step(Path("cwl_adapters") / "append.cwl")
append.inputs.str = "Hello"

cat = Step(Path("cwl_adapters") / "cat.cwl")

workflow = Workflow([touch, append, cat], "multistep_python")
workflow.write_artifacts()
```

Here Sophios infers:

```text
touch.outputs.file -> append.inputs.file
append.outputs.file -> cat.inputs.file
```

Use inference when the workflow is a clear linear chain and the generated graph
is easy to inspect. Prefer explicit bindings when multiple prior outputs could
match, when names matter, or when the workflow definition must make data flow
unambiguous without relying on generated artifacts.

## Binding Types

There are two common input binding patterns.

| Binding | Python shape | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Literal value | `step.inputs.message = "hello"` | The value is known now. |
| Step output | `cat.inputs.file = append.outputs.file` | The value comes from an earlier step. |

This table is one of the most important concepts in the Python API. Most
workflow code is a readable sequence of these bindings.

## What Bindings Become

Python assignments in a Sophios workflow are declarative. They do not execute a
command when the assignment runs. They record enough information for the
compiler to generate a CWL workflow and a CWL job input object.

For example, this literal binding:

```python
echo.inputs.message = "hello"
```

becomes part of the generated job input data. Sophios keeps the value out of the
CWL tool definition so the compiled workflow and runtime inputs remain separate.

This edge binding:

```python
cat.inputs.file = append.outputs.file
```

becomes a CWL workflow `source` relationship. The compiled workflow connects the
concrete output port from the `append` step to the concrete input port on the
`cat` step.

The practical rule is: write Python that describes the graph, then inspect the
generated CWL when exact execution behavior matters.

## Named Workflow Outputs

Outputs should also be deliberate.

```python
workflow.outputs.captured_stdout = echo.outputs.stdout
```

That line exposes the step output as part of the workflow's public output
interface.

Use named workflow outputs when a downstream user, test, or execution service
needs a stable result name.

## Export `.wic` From Python

Every `Workflow` can render the lower-level Sophios workflow representation.
For a quick in-memory view, inspect `workflow.yaml`:

```python
print(workflow.yaml)
```

This shows the bridge between Python objects and the lower-level Sophios
representation. It is useful when debugging surprising bindings before
compilation.

When you want a real `.wic` file, use `write_wic()`:

```python
workflow.write_wic("hello_python.wic")
```

This writes a source `.wic` workflow from the Python object. It does not compile
the workflow and it does not write generated CWL. Literal bindings, named
outputs, explicit edges, and intentionally unbound linear inputs are preserved
in the `.wic` representation so the normal Sophios compiler can still apply
edge inference later.

If you need the text instead of a file:

```python
wic_text = workflow.to_wic()
```

For nested workflows, `write_wic()` embeds subworkflows in the root document by
default. If you want a sibling-file tree instead, pass
`inline_subworkflows=False`:

```python
workflow.write_wic("workflows", inline_subworkflows=False)
```

## Compile Paths

Sophios gives you two common compile paths.

Compilation is the point where the high-level Python workflow becomes concrete
CWL. During compilation, Sophios validates the workflow structure, resolves
explicit bindings, applies edge inference where inputs were intentionally left
unbound, emits runtime input data for literal values, and produces a CWL
workflow document that can be inspected or executed by a CWL runner.

### Write Artifacts to Disk

```python
workflow.write_artifacts()
```

Use this when you want to inspect generated files. Typical artifacts include:

- `autogenerated/<workflow>.cwl`,
- `autogenerated/<workflow>_inputs.yml`,
- Graphviz files when graph output is enabled.

This is the best path when generated artifacts need to be reviewed, committed to
a test fixture, or inspected during debugging.

`workflow.compile(write_to_disk=True)` is still available. `write_artifacts()`
is the clearer public method for the common "compile and inspect files" path.
Neither method writes intermediate `.wic` compiler trees by default. Use
`workflow.write_wic(...)` when you want a source `.wic` file.

### Keep Compiled CWL in Memory

```python
compiled = workflow.get_cwl_workflow()
```

Use this when the next step is another Python operation, such as packaging a
submission payload.

The returned object contains:

- the compiled CWL workflow fields,
- the workflow name,
- generated `yaml_inputs`.

Submission payloads commonly expect the CWL workflow document and job inputs as
separate pieces. The compute payload guide shows one concrete service-oriented
payload shape in detail.

## Running Locally

Run locally with:

```python
workflow.run()
```

Sophios supports two local CWL runners through `Workflow.run()`:

- `cwltool`, the default local runner,
- `toil-cwl-runner`, for local execution through Toil.

Runtime options can be passed through `run_args_dict`:

```python
workflow.run(
    run_args_dict={
        "cwl_runner": "cwltool",
        "container_engine": "docker",
        "copy_output_files": "yes",
    }
)
```

To run the same workflow with Toil, switch the runner:

```python
workflow.run(
    run_args_dict={
        "cwl_runner": "toil-cwl-runner",
        "container_engine": "docker",
        "logLevel": "INFO",
    }
)
```

Sophios uses recognized local-run options for setup and passes runner-specific
key/value options to the selected CWL runner. See
[Running a Multistep Workflow Locally](multistep_runner.md) for a complete
example.

Local execution is best for:

- verifying small workflows,
- verifying tool contracts,
- checking generated outputs before submission,
- verifying end-to-end behavior in a controlled environment.

If the workflow needs a large container image or special hardware, compile first
and inspect the generated artifacts before attempting a full run.

## Nested Workflows

A workflow can contain another workflow:

```python
preprocess = Workflow([touch, append], "preprocess")
report = Workflow([preprocess, cat], "report")
```

Nested workflows are how large pipelines are split into named components. A
subworkflow can have its own inputs, outputs, tests, and documentation.

Use nesting when a group of steps has a meaningful name:

- "preprocess",
- "segment",
- "measure",
- "summarize",
- "submit".

## Scatter and Conditionals

CWL supports scatter and conditional execution. Sophios exposes those controls
through small step-level settings:

```python
echo.scatter_on(echo.inputs.message, method="dotproduct")
```

```python
echo.when = "$(inputs.message != '')"
```

These features are powerful and should be used with explicit review of the
generated CWL. Scatter changes the shape of values. Conditionals can make
outputs nullable. Both affect downstream type compatibility and runtime
behavior.

The current lightweight `when_pyapi.py` example runs locally, but CWL correctly
warns that outputs from conditional steps may be `null`. That warning is
expected: conditional execution changes the output type contract.

The lightweight `scatter_pyapi.py` example uses a CWL `Any` output because the
array-producing tool is intentionally generic. Sophios treats `Any` as
permissive for explicit Python bindings while keeping compiler edge inference
conservative.

## Generated Files

When you compile or run with disk output enabled, Sophios writes useful
artifacts:

- `autogenerated/<workflow>.cwl`: compiled root CWL workflow.
- `autogenerated/<workflow>_inputs.yml`: generated job inputs.
- `autogenerated/schemas/`: generated schemas for `.wic` validation.
- `cachedir*`: CWL runner caches and intermediate files.
- `provenance/`: CWL provenance data unless disabled.
- `outdir/`: copied primary outputs when output copying is enabled.
- `error_<workflow>.txt`: tracebacks from compilation or runner startup failures.

Intermediate compiler `.wic` trees are not written under `autogenerated/` during
normal compilation. The CLI writes them only when explicitly invoked with
`--write_intermediate_wic`.

These files are the main debugging surface. A serious workflow should be
reviewed through its generated artifacts, not only through the Python code.

## Troubleshooting

When a workflow fails:

- Compile before running. If compilation fails, the issue is in the workflow
  structure or tool contract.
- Inspect `workflow.yaml` to check bindings before compilation.
- Inspect `autogenerated/<workflow>.cwl` and the generated inputs after
  compilation.
- Re-run without quiet settings if you need full CWL runner output.
- Check whether a container image is being pulled.
- Delete `autogenerated/`, `cachedir*`, `outdir/`, and `provenance/` when you
  need a clean local run.
- Replace advanced controls with simpler bindings when isolating a failure.

## Maintained Examples

The following examples are intended to stay lightweight:

- `examples/scripts/helloworld_pyapi.py`: smallest Python workflow.
- `examples/scripts/multistep1_pyapi.py`: step-to-step file flow.
- `examples/scripts/multistep1_toJson_pyapi.py`: in-memory compiled workflow JSON.
- `examples/scripts/multistep_runner_pyapi.py`: local runner selection for a multistep workflow.
- `examples/scripts/reusable_interface_pyapi.py`: reusable workflow interface example.
- `examples/scripts/scatter_pyapi.py`: scatter over array-valued bindings.
- `examples/scripts/when_pyapi.py`: conditional execution.
- `examples/scripts/tool_builder_workflow.py`: generated CLTs composed in memory.
- `examples/scripts/compute_payload_workflow.py`: Python workflow to validated compute payload.

The Ichnaea and SAM3 walkthroughs are larger, production-oriented examples with
heavier runtime assumptions.
