# The Sophios Language Reference

**Version:** `lang_version` 0.0.1
**Substrate:** CWL v1.2

This is the human-readable definition of **Sophios**, the workflow language.
The executable definition is `sophios.lang` — the typed AST and parser — and
the two are meant to agree. Where they disagree, that is a bug in one of them.

## The language and its two surfaces

Sophios is the language. It has one DSL, and that DSL can be written two ways:

| Surface | How it is written | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **YAML** | The YAML-based spelling of the DSL | Conventionally in files named `.wic` |
| **Python API** | `Workflow`, `Step`, `CommandLineTool` | Python source |

Neither is "the language" and neither is subordinate to the other. They are two
ways of saying the same thing, which is why §6 can state what each owes the
other and check it.

`.wic` is **a file extension, not a language**. This document says "`.wic`
files" when it means files on disk, and "Sophios" when it means the language.
A handful of spellings inside the syntax still carry the older `wic` prefix —
the `wic:` block, the `!ii` / `!&` / `!*` tags, and the `wic_*` desugared keys.
Those are concrete syntax that existing workflows depend on, so they stay as
they are; they are not evidence that the language is called wic.

---

## 1. What kind of language this is

Sophios is a **leaky abstraction over CWL, deliberately**. You write shorthand
for the common case and drop into raw CWL for anything the shorthand does not
cover. Sealing the abstraction would mean re-inventing CWL one feature at a
time and asking users to wait.

The abstraction leaks in three ways, and knowing which is which is the whole
point of this document:

| Category | What Sophios does | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Sophios-owned** | Consumes it; never appears in the output | `!ii`, `!&`, `!*`, `!cwl`, the `wic:` block |
| **Interpreted CWL** | Reads it *and acts on it* | `scatter`, `scatterMethod`, `when`, inline `run` |
| **Passthrough CWL** | Copies it out unchanged | `$namespaces`, `$schemas`, `requirements`, `hints`, everything else |

The interpreted set is closed and listed in §4.3. **Anything not in it is
passthrough, by definition.** That rule is what makes the leak a contract
rather than a surprise.

---

## 2. Document structure

In its YAML surface, a Sophios document is a YAML mapping. Every key is optional.

```yaml
wic:            # optional  — compiler metadata, never emitted to CWL
steps:          # the workflow's steps
inputs:         # CWL workflow inputs        (passthrough)
outputs:        # CWL workflow outputs       (passthrough)
$namespaces:    # any other CWL key          (passthrough)
```

An empty document is well-formed and carries nothing.

## 3. Steps

### 3.1 Three surface forms

All three are long-standing, all remain supported, and **all produce the same
result**. Use whichever reads better.

**Mapping, keyed by step name** — cannot repeat a step name:

```yaml
steps:
  touch:
    in:
      filename: !ii empty.txt
```

**Sequence with `id:`** — required when the same tool appears twice:

```yaml
steps:
- id: append
  in: {str: !ii Hello}
- id: append
  in: {str: !ii World}
```

**Sequence of single-key mappings** — the key is the step name:

```yaml
steps:
- touch:
    in:
      filename: !ii empty.txt
```

A step may have no body at all:

```yaml
steps:
  some_subworkflow.wic:
```

### 3.2 Step keys

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `in` | Input bindings (§4) |
| `out` | Output bindings (§3.3) |
| `scatter`, `scatterMethod` | Interpreted: Sophios adds `ScatterFeatureRequirement` |
| `when` | Interpreted: Sophios adds `InlineJavascriptRequirement` |
| `run` | Interpreted: an inline CWL tool definition |
| *anything else* | Passthrough |

### 3.3 Outputs

`out:` is a sequence. An entry is either a bare name, or a name bound to an
edge definition:

```yaml
out:
- file                    # just names the output
- file: !& file_touch     # names it and defines an edge
```

---

## 4. Input values

### 4.1 The five forms

A step input is exactly one of these. There is no sixth form.

| Form | Written | Means |
|---|---|---|
| Inline literal | `f: !ii empty.txt` | A literal value. Never an edge. |
| Edge definition | `f: !& name` | Defines an explicit edge at this point |
| Edge reference | `f: !* name` | Consumes an edge defined elsewhere |
| Raw CWL reference | `f: !cwl step/out` | Opaque to Sophios; passed through unresolved |
| Unresolved name | `f: some_input` | Must resolve to a workflow input |

An untagged bare string is an **unresolved name**. If it does not name a
workflow input, you get a diagnostic telling you which of the two remedies you
probably meant — `!ii` for a literal, `!cwl` for a CWL reference.

`!ii` accepts any YAML value, not just scalars:

```yaml
in:
  config: !ii
    pdb_code: 1aki
```

### 4.2 Each input is bound once

An `in:` mapping may name a given input only once. Binding it twice is an
error, not a last-one-wins:

```yaml
in:
  f: !ii a
  f: !ii b     # error: input 'f' is bound more than once
```

YAML itself leaves repeated keys undefined, so honouring either binding would
mean choosing silently on the writer's behalf. The second binding is almost
always a copy-paste mistake, and saying so costs less than debugging the one
that got dropped.

### 4.3 Interpreted CWL keys

The complete set Sophios reads and acts upon:

```
scatter    scatterMethod    when    run
```

Everything else on a step is passthrough.

---

## 5. The `wic:` block

Compiler metadata. Never emitted to CWL.

```yaml
wic:
  graphviz:
    label: Protein-ligand docking
  default_implementation: gromacs
  steps:
    (1, extract):
      wic:
        graphviz:
          label: extract structures
```

Step keys inside `wic: steps:` have the form `(index, name)` — the index is
1-based and matches the step's position. Sophios parses these into a structured
key; you should never have to parse that string yourself.

A bare `wic:` with nothing under it is an empty block, not an error.

---

## 6. How the two surfaces adhere

This is the part that keeps the language single.

### 6.1 Two spellings per construct

Within the YAML surface, every Sophios-owned construct has a **tagged** form
and a **desugared** form, and they are equivalent:

| Construct | Tagged | Desugared |
|---|---|---|
| Inline literal | `!ii value` | `{wic_inline_input: value}` |
| Edge definition | `!& name` | `{wic_anchor: name}` |
| Edge reference | `!* name` | `{wic_alias: name}` |
| Raw CWL reference | `!cwl expr` | `{wic_raw_cwl: expr}` |

The desugared form exists for a specific reason: a YAML constructor that
re-emitted its own tag would fire again when the document is reloaded, so the
loader would not be idempotent. Machine-generated documents therefore use the
desugared spelling.

**Write the tagged form.** The desugared form is what tooling emits.

### 6.2 What each surface must do

**`.wic` files** are the YAML surface as written. They are parsed by
`sophios.lang.parse`, which accepts both spellings above, and written by
`sophios.lang.render`, which emits the tagged one. The two are inverses:
parsing a rendered document reproduces the document it came from, which is what
lets a disagreement between this text and the parser show up as a test failure
rather than as a surprise.

**The Python API** (`Workflow`, `Step`) is the second surface of the same
language. `Workflow.write_wic()` and `.to_wic_yaml()` emit `.wic` documents,
using the desugared spelling and sequence-form steps with explicit `id:`.

Two obligations follow, and both are enforced by tests rather than convention:

1. **Whatever the Python API emits must parse.** An API that produced
   documents its own parser rejects would mean two languages wearing one name.
2. **Both spellings must produce the same result.** `!ii x` and
   `{wic_inline_input: x}` are the same input, so compiling either must give
   the same answer.

The second obligation is checked as a property over generated inputs, not by
example — see `tests/core/test_lang_parser.py`.

### 6.3 What this does *not* cover

This document defines **syntax**: whether a Sophios document is well-formed. Two
further questions are deliberately separate because they depend on the
environment, not the language:

- **Resolution** — do the step names refer to tools that exist *here*?
- **Type checking** — do the connected ports have compatible types?

A document can be perfectly well-formed and still fail to resolve on a machine
without the right plugins installed. That is not a language error.

---

## 7. Versioning

`lang_version` starts at **0.0.1**, defined against CWL v1.2. The Sophios
version and its CWL substrate move together.

The version tag is **optional and expected to stay unused**. An untagged file
is compiled at the highest `lang_version` under which that source actually
compiles — not merely the newest version available. That means:

- A file using only long-standing syntax resolves to the newest version.
- A file using syntax a later version dropped resolves to the newest version
  that still accepts it, and keeps working.
- A file using syntax only a newer version added resolves there automatically,
  with no tag required to adopt a feature.

You need a tag only to pin a file for reproducibility, or where a construct is
valid under two versions with different meanings.

The version Sophios actually chose is always reported — on the command line, on
`CompiledWorkflow`, and as an annotation in the emitted CWL. You should never
have to guess which language your file was read as.
