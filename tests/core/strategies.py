"""Generators for Sophios source text.

Shared because more than one suite quantifies over the same language: the
parser's properties, the renderer's round trip, and the schema's forward
direction all need documents, and a second generator beside the first is how
outputs and nested sidecars once became invisible to every property fed by it.

The alphabets here are deliberate. Each was widened in response to a class of
finding — spellings whose text differs from their value, keys carrying `$`,
empty names — and narrowing one narrows every property downstream.
