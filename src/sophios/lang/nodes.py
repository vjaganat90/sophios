"""Typed AST for the Sophios language.

The nodes here are the executable specification of the syntax layer: what a
well-formed Sophios document may contain, independent of which tools happen to
be installed. See design_docs/core-refactor-design.md, Spec 1.

Every node is frozen and slotted. Frozen because an AST that consumers can
mutate is not a specification of anything; slotted because these are allocated
once per construct in a document and the dict-per-instance overhead is pure
waste.
