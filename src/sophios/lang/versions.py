"""The Sophios language version: what exists, and how one is chosen.

The reference (§7) defines the scheme: `lang_version` starts at 0.0.1, the tag
is optional and expected to stay unused, and an untagged file is compiled at
the highest version under which its source actually compiles. Today exactly
one version exists, so resolution always lands on 0.0.1 — but the *mechanism*
is written for the general case and property-tested with fabricated version
lists, because the first real version bump is precisely when nobody will want
to discover the resolver was a stub.

Selection precedence (§5.8 of the design):

    1. an explicit setting — the `--lang_version` flag or API parameter
    2. per-file `lang_version` tags, which are exact pins
    3. the newest version that satisfies everything, which for untagged
       trees is simply the newest version

One compilation resolves to exactly one version, tree-wide. Conflicting exact
pins therefore cannot be satisfied and are reported, not averaged.
